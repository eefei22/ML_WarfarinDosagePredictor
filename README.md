# ML_WarfarinDosagePredictor
My ML assignment on predicting therapeutic dosage of warfarin

1) INTRODUCTION
This project is designed for undergraduate students who are taking the WIA1006 OR WID3006 in semester
2, session 2022/2023. The theme of the project is HEALTHCARE HACKS. In this project, you will be working
in a group of 5 to explore and analyze a specific domain in healthcare using machine learning techniques.
Your goal is to develop a machine learning model that can help to solve a real-world problem in healthcare.
2.0 PROJECT DETAILS
The team is required to develop a machine learning model that could do a specific task such as
classification, prediction or recommendation. Below are some of the examples of ML project that could
be the kickstart of your innovation idea:
1. Predicting patient who are most likely to be readmitted to the hospital within a certain timeframe.
2. Classify type of cancer (e.g., benign or malignant)
3. Predicting patient outcomes such as mortality or length of hospital stay
You can explore more interesting project online and can take those examples as an inspiration to develop
your own model.
The flow of the work could be as the following:
Brainstorming Data Collection Pre-processing

Selection
Model Training
and Evaluation

1. Brainstorming: As a group, you should first brainstorm and come up with a specific domain in
healthcare that you are interested in exploring. This could be anything from predicting patient
outcomes to diagnosing diseases.
2. Data Collection: Once you have decided on a domain, you will need to collect data that is relevant
to your project. You can use publicly available datasets or collect data on your own. Ensure that
your data is relevant, reliable, and sufficient for your project.
3. Pre-processing: After collecting your data, you will need to preprocess it to make it suitable for
machine learning. This may include cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, and
transformation.
4. Model Selection: Once your data is ready, you will need to choose an appropriate machine learning
algorithm for your project. You may choose from supervised or unsupervised learning, and select
the model based on the problem you are trying to solve.
5. Model Training and Evaluation: Once you have selected the model, you will need to train it on your
preprocessed data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics. You may need to finetune your model to improve its performance.
6. Final Deliverable: Finally, you will need to present your findings and results in a clear and concise
manner. This may include a project report, code implementation, and a presentation.
3.0 DATASET
Accessing public datasets in the healthcare domain can sometimes be challenging due to privacy concerns
and restrictions on data sharing. However, there are several publicly available healthcare datasets that can
be used for Machine Learning projects. Here are a few examples:
1) MIMIC-III: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) is a large public dataset of deidentified electronic health records from patients admitted to the intensive care unit. It includes
information such as vital signs, lab values, medications, and diagnoses.
2) SEER: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program is a public dataset of cancer
incidence and survival data from the National Cancer Institute. It includes information on
demographics, cancer site, stage, and treatment.
3) NHANES: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a public dataset of health
and nutrition data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It includes information on
demographics, health behaviors, and clinical measurements.
4) PhysioNet: The PhysioNet project provides access to a variety of publicly available datasets related to
physiological signals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and blood
pressure waveforms.

5) OpenFDA: The OpenFDA project provides access to a variety of datasets related to drugs, medical
devices, and adverse events reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
6) COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19): This dataset includes tens of thousands of scholarly
articles about COVID-19 and related viruses. It is intended to facilitate research and analysis related
to the pandemic.
7) Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia): This dataset includes thousands of chest X-ray images labeled as
either normal, bacterial pneumonia, or viral pneumonia. It can be used to develop Machine Learning
models for diagnosing pneumonia.
8) Skin Cancer MNIST: This dataset includes over 10,000 images of skin lesions labeled as either
malignant or benign. It can be used to develop Machine Learning models for detecting skin cancer.
9) MURA (Musculoskeletal Radiographs): This dataset includes over 40,000 musculoskeletal radiographs
labeled as either normal or abnormal. It can be used to develop Machine Learning models for
diagnosing musculoskeletal conditions.
10) PhysioBank: This repository includes a variety of physiological signal datasets, such as ECGs, EEGs, and
blood pressure waveforms. These datasets can be used to develop Machine Learning models for
detecting abnormal physiological patterns.
Above are the examples of dataset that potentially can be used for your project. You can find it on GitHub
and some on their own website. You can explore and use other dataset than whatever listed above. There
is no restriction on exploring new dataset that is suitable for your specific project.
Note that, there are limited datasets for the certain problems in healthcare domain due to the privacy
issue. Thus, you may need to develop or collect your own datasets for the problems that you have chosen.
There is even a possibility of developing a pseudo-dataset to demonstrate your proposed problem and
solution.
So be creative!
